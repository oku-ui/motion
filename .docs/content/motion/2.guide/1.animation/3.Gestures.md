Oku Motion extends the basic set of event listeners provided by Vue3 with a simple yet powerful set of UI gesture recognisers.

It currently has support for hover, press and more. Each gesture has a series of event listeners that you can attach to your `motion` component.

## Animation helpers

`motion` components provide multiple gesture animation props: `whileHover`, `whileTap`, `whileFocus`, `whileDrag` and `whileInView`. These can define animation targets to temporarily animate to while a gesture is active.

## Hover

The hover gesture detects when a pointer hovers a component.
